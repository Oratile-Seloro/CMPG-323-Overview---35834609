# CMPG-323-Overview---35834609

## Plan for CMPG 323 Projects
For the upcoming projects I will be using different repositories for each project. The storage of credentials and sensitive information will be on Azure Security Center. I will connect my GitHub to Azure Security Center to ensure that my repositories are secure.

### Project 2
The repository that will be created for this project will be named 'CMPG 323 Project 2 - 35834609'. It will be linked to the API project that I will create for the project. The project will contain .NET Core Web API code. The branching strategy to be used in this project will be the GitHub Flow, where first the main branch is done then more branches are created that are linked under the main branch. The gitignore file in this project will be the VisualStudios files because I will be using VisualStudios when creating my App service.

### Project 3 
The repository that will be created for this project will be named 'CMPG 323 Project 3 - 35834609'. It will be linked to the project that will be used for this repository. The branching strategy to be used in this project will be the Git Flow, where I will be isolating my work into different branches.The gitignore file in this project will be the VisualStudios files because I will be using VisualStudios in this project.
